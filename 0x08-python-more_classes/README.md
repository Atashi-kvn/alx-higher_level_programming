## Resources
Read or watch:
- [Object Oriented Programming](#) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
- [Object-Oriented Programming](#) (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
- [Class and Instance Attributes](#)
- [classmethods and staticmethods](#)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](#) (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
- [str vs repr](#)

## Learning Objectives

## Tasks
### 0. Simple rectangle
Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

#!/usr/bin/python3
Rectangle = __import__('0-rectangle').Rectangle

my_rectangle = Rectangle()
print(type(my_rectangle))
print(my_rectangle.__dict__)

---

#### 1. Real definition of a rectangle

- **File:** `1-rectangle.py`
- **Description:** Defines a `Rectangle` class with private attributes `width` and `height`, along with properties to retrieve and set them. The class ensures that width and height are integers and greater than or equal to zero. It also allows instantiation with optional width and height.

---

#### 2. Area and Perimeter

- **File:** `2-rectangle.py`
- **Description:** Extends the `Rectangle` class to include public methods for calculating area and perimeter. It calculates the area as the product of width and height, and the perimeter as the sum of all sides. If either width or height is zero, the perimeter is set to zero.

---

#### 3. String representation

- **File:** `3-rectangle.py`
- **Description:** Enhances the `Rectangle` class to provide string representations using `print()` and `str()`. It prints the rectangle using '#' characters and handles cases where width or height is zero.

---

#### 4. Eval is magic

- **File:** `4-rectangle.py`
- **Description:** Modifies the `Rectangle` class to support the `repr()` function for string representation. This allows recreating instances using `eval()`. The string representation includes the class name and the dimensions of the rectangle.

---

#### 5. Detect instance deletion

- **File:** `5-rectangle.py`
- **Description:** Adds functionality to print a farewell message when an instance of `Rectangle` is deleted using `del`. This ensures proper cleanup and provides feedback on instance deletion.

---

#### 6. How many instances

- **File:** `6-rectangle.py`
- **Description:** Implements a mechanism to track the number of instances created and deleted. It uses a class attribute `number_of_instances` to keep count and increments/decrements it accordingly during instance creation/deletion.

---

#### 7. Change representation

- **File:** `7-rectangle.py`
- **Description:** Allows customizing the character used for string representation by introducing a class attribute `print_symbol`. This symbol is used instead of '#' when printing the rectangle.

---

#### 8. Compare rectangles

- **File:** `8-rectangle.py`
- **Description:** Provides a static method `bigger_or_equal()` to compare two rectangles based on their areas. It returns the rectangle with the larger area, or the first rectangle if both have the same area.

---

#### 9. A square is a rectangle

- **File:** `9-rectangle.py`
- **Description:** Introduces a class method `square()` to create square instances of `Rectangle` where width and height are equal. This simplifies the creation of square objects without needing to specify both dimensions separately.

---

These classes provide a comprehensive toolkit for working with rectangles in Python, offering functionality for instantiation, manipulation, comparison, and deletion.
