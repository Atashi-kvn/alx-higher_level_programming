Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project focuses on utilizing conditionals, loops, and functions in Python. It includes examples of if/else statements, various types of loops, and function prototypes. The code files provided demonstrate how to effectively use these concepts and showcase their practical applications.

Tasks :page_with_curl:

The project includes several tasks that cover different aspects of if/else, loops, and functions. Each task focuses on a specific problem or concept and provides a code file with a detailed description. Here is an overview of the tasks:
Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing

    File: 0-positive_or_negative.py
    Description: A Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. It then determines whether number is positive or negative and prints the appropriate message.
    Output format: number is [positive/negative/zero]

Task 1: The last digit

    File: 1-last_digit.py
    Description: A Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. It then determines the last digit of number and prints it along with additional information.
    Output format: Last digit of [number] is [last_digit] and is [greater than 5/less than 6 and not 0/equal to 0]

Task 2: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

    File: 2-print_alphabet.py
    Description: A Python program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, all on one line, without any separators.
    Output: The sequence of lowercase letters from a to z

Task 3: When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

    File: 3-print_alphabt.py
    Description: A Python program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, all on one line, without any separators, except for the letters q and e.
    Output: The sequence of lowercase letters from a to z, excluding q and e

Task 4: Hexadecimal printing

    File: 4-print_hexa.py
    Description: A Python program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.
    Output format: [decimal] = [hexadecimal]

Task 5: 00...99

    File: 5-print_comb2.py
    Description: A Python program that prints numbers from 00 to 99, two digits per number, separated by ,, except for the last number, which is followed by a new line.
    Output format: 00, 01, 02, ..., 98, 99

Task 6:
Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need

    File: 6-print_comb3.py
    Description: A Python program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order, with no repetition.
    Output format: 01, 02, 03, ..., 98, 99

Task 7: islower

    File: 7-islower.py
    Description: A Python function that checks whether a character is lowercase.
    Function signature: def islower(c):
    Returns: True if the character is lowercase, False otherwise

Task 8: To uppercase

    File: 8-uppercase.py
    Description: A Python function that prints a string in uppercase.
    Function signature: def uppercase(str):
    Takes a string as input and prints it in uppercase, followed by a new line.

Task 9: There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

    File: 9-print_last_digit.py
    Description: A Python function that prints the last digit of a number.
    Function signature: def print_last_digit(number):
    Takes an integer as input and prints the last digit.
