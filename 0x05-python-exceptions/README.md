# Python Exception Handling

Welcome to the Python Exception Handling project! In this project, we explore how to handle exceptions in Python to write more robust and error-tolerant code. Understanding and effectively managing exceptions is crucial for creating reliable software.

## Introduction to Exceptions

Exceptions are a way to handle errors and exceptional situations that can occur during the execution of a program. Python provides a structured approach to handle exceptions using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.

## Basic Exception Handling

try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")


Learn how to handle basic exceptions and gracefully recover from them.

## Handling Multiple Exceptions

```
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.")
```

Explore how to handle different types of exceptions using multiple `except` blocks.

## Using `else` and `finally`

```
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
else:
    print("Result:", result)
finally:
    print("Execution finished.")
```

Understand the role of the `else` and `finally` blocks in exception handling.

## Raising Exceptions

```
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero!")
    return a / b
```

Learn how to raise exceptions to signal specific error conditions.

## Custom Exceptions

```
class CustomError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message

try:
    raise CustomError("This is a custom exception.")
except CustomError as e:
    print("Custom Error:", e.message)
```

Discover how to create and use custom exceptions to enhance error handling.

## Conclusion

Exception handling is a fundamental skill for writing reliable and robust Python programs. By effectively handling exceptions, you can prevent crashes and unexpected behavior, leading to a more user-friendly and stable application.
